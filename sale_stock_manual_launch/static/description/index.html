        <h4>Usage</h4>
        <p>Upon confirmation the sale order no longer creates a picking or launch procurement rules. instead, a wizard is added to specify which
            products and which quantities to launch first.</p>
        <div class="oe_row_img oe_pic_ctr oe_mt32"><img class="oe_picture oe_screenshot" src="img.png"/></div>
        <p>You can choose from the wizard which lines/quanities to launch.</p>
        <div class="oe_row_img oe_pic_ctr oe_mt32"><img class="oe_picture oe_screenshot" src="img_1.png"/></div>
        <p>The system tracks which quantities were launched. Moreover if a picking was mistakenly cancelled, you can still launch it again with the
            wizard.</p>
