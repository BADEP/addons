        <p>
            This module extends the native push notifications of Odoo to support all incoming messages instead of just chat messages.
        </p>
        <h3>Configuration</h3>
        <p>None</p>
        <h3>Usage</h3>
        <p>Each time a user receives an incoming message they will also receive a native notification for it. The user can also click on the notification to open the related document.</p>
        <h3>Limitation</h3>
        <p>This module uses the longpolling bus to send notifications and therefore needs an active session (open browser with connected user) in order to receive notifications. A background service worker like firebase can be used in the future to deliver push notifications even if there is no active session.</p>
